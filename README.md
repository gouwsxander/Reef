# Reef

The macOS window manager that gives every app its own alt-tab. 

Reef lets you bind applications to number keys and cycle through their windows all through the keyboard.

We built Reef because we wanted a _minimal_ window manager.

## Key Features

- Bind applications to number keys to refocus to **any** window for that app
- Assign profiles for different sets of bindings
- Do your binding and profile management through the keyboard
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts

### Example

Press `Control + 1` to cycle through Chrome windows. 

`Control + 2` for your terminal. 

`Control + 3` for Slack. 

You get the idea.

<summary><b>Why Reef?</b></summary>
<br>
