# Reef

The macOS window manager that gives every app its own alt-tab.

## What it does

Reef lets you bind applications to number keys, to cycle through their windows. It's like alt-tab, but faster.

Press `Control + 1` to cycle through Chrome windows. `Control + 2` for your terminal. `Control + 3` for Slack. You get the idea.

## Why "Reef"?

The name comes from the starts of refocus and reframe. And, like a coral reef supports a diverse ecosystem, Reef supports your workspace—helping you navigate between windows quickly and easily.
