# Reef

A macOS window manager for lightning-fast context switching.

## What it does

Reef lets you bind applications to number keys, to cycle through their windows. It's like alt-tab, but faster.

Press `Control + 1` to cycle through Chrome windows. `Control + 2` for your terminal. `Control + 3` for Slack. You get the idea.

## Why "Reef"?

The name comes from the starts of refocus and reframe. And, like a coral reef supports a diverse ecosystem, Reef supports your workspace—helping you navigate between windows quickly and easily.

## Features

- **Bind apps to numbers:** Assign any application to number keys 0-9
- **Fast window cycling:** Jump between apps and windows easily
- **Customizable modifiers:** Use Shift, Control, Command, Option, or any combination
- **Multiple profiles:** Switch between different setups for coding, editing, etc.
